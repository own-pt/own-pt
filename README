#+TITLE: Open Portuguese WordNet (OWN-PT)

This repository hosts Portuguese WordNet data in textual format, this is an experimental branch of http://openwordnet-pt.org. It is linked to (but independent from) the [[https://github.com/own-pt/own-en/][Open English WordNet]]. 

You can also get the data in JSON and RDF format.

See the [[https://github.com/own-pt/own-en/wiki/][Wiki]] for how the data was generated, how it compares to Princeton WordNet and what is the syntax of the text files. This data is validated and exported by the [[https://github.com/own-pt/mill/][mill tool]] â€” see its
repository for more information about validation, export formats, etc.
